kitty (0.13.1-1yk1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    + Fix passing input via the pipe action to a program without a window not
      working.
    + Linux: Fix a regression in the previous release that caused automatic
      selection of bold/italic fonts when using aliases such as "monospace" to not
      work (issue 1209)
    + Fix resizing window smaller and then restoring causing some wrapped lines to not
      be properly unwrapped (issue 1206)
    + Add an option ‘scrollback_pager_history_size’ to tell kitty to store
      extended scrollback to use when viewing the scrollback buffer in a pager
      (issue 970)
    + Modify the kittens sub-system to allow creating custom kittens without any
      user interface. This is useful for creating more complex actions that can
      be bound to key presses in ‘kitty.conf’. See
      kittens/custom.rst. (issue 870)
    + Add a new ‘nth_window’ action that can be used to go to the nth window and
      also previously active windows, using negative numbers. Similarly,
      ‘goto_tab’ now accepts negative numbers to go to previously active tabs
      (issue 1040)
    + Allow hiding the tab bar completely, by setting ‘tab_bar_style’ to
      ‘hidden’. (issue 1014)
    + Allow private use unicode characters to stretch over more than a single
      neighboring space (pull request 1036)
    + Add a new ‘touch_scroll_multiplier’ option to modify the amount
      scrolled by high precision scrolling devices such as touchpads (pull request 1129)
    + icat kitten: Implement reading image data from STDIN, if STDIN is not
      connected to a terminal (issue 1130)
    + hints kitten: Insert trailing spaces after matches when using the
      ‘--multiple’ option. Also add a separate ‘--add-trailing-space’
      option to control this behavior (pull request 1132)
    + Fix the ‘*_with_cwd’ actions using the cwd of the overlay window rather
      than the underlying window’s cwd (issue 1045)
    + Fix incorrect key repeat rate on wayland (pull request 1055)

  * WIP patch: Display tab numbers in the tab bar
