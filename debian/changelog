kitty (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ upstream ]
  * Fix build failures related to unsigned char or big-endian platforms.
    (Closes: #896099)
  * New kitten for performing/viewing diffs
  * Output GL version when running with --debug-gl (to help with #897381)

  [ James McCoy ]
  * rules:
    + Override upstream's CFLAGS instead of augmenting them
    + Export CPPFLAGS independently, now that upstream's buildsystem
      explicitly handles them
  * Add a watch file
  * Update d/copyright for 0.9.1
  * control:
    + Add libx11-xcb-dev to Build-Depends instead of relying on it implicitly
      being installed
    * Recommend kitty-doc from kitty package so documentation is typically
      available
  * Convert asciidoc files into html documentation (Closes: #897003)
    + Add asciidoctor to Build-Depends-Indep
    + Create new kitty-doc package
