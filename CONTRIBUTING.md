### Reporting bugs

Please first search existing bug reports (especially closed ones) for a report
that matches your issue. 

When reporting a bug, provide full details of your environment, that means, at
a minimum, kitty version, OS and OS version, kitty config (ideally a minimal
config to reproduce the issue with).


### Contributing code

Install [the dependencies](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/build.html#dependencies)
using your favorite package manager. Build and run kitty [from
source](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/build.html#install-and-run-from-source).

Make a fork, submit your Pull Request. If it's a large/controversial change, open an issue
beforehand to discuss it, so that you don't waste your time making a pull
request that gets rejected.

If the code you are submitting is reasonably easily testable, please contribute
tests as well (see the `kitty_tests/` sub-directory for existing tests, which
can be run with `./test.py`).

That's it.
